- A process is an instance of a program that is currently being executed. It is an independent entity that consists of an address space, a set of data structures, and one or more threads of execution. The state of a process can be represented by various states, such as running, ready, waiting, and terminated. Process models can vary, but common ones include the parent-child model and the peer model.
