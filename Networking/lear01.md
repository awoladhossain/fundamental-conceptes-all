# What is a Network?

`Network is a system where two or more devices are connected to communicate with each other.`

## 📦 How is Data Transmitted?
Think of it like sending a letter to a friend:

1. You write the letter (data)
2. You put it in an envelope (packaging)
3. You write the address (IP address)
4. You give it to the post office (router)
5. It reaches your friend (destination)
The same logic applies in networks! Data is divided into small pieces called packets and sent to the destination.

## 🔑 Basic Concepts
